    Overview:

        Shader program 'debug':
            Get shader desc: debug_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_position = 0
                Uniform block 'MVP':
                    C struct: MVP_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_MVP = 0
            Fragment shader: fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader debug = sg_make_shader(debug_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_position] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'MVP':

        MVP_t MVP = {
            .mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_MVP, &SG_RANGE(MVP));
